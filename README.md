# Free Space Detector

**University of Moratuwa - Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering Department**  
**Project Team:** Wired Wizards, 21st Batch

## Overview

The Free Space Detector is designed to provide real-time information about available seating in libraries and other public spaces. This device helps users save time and reduce frustration by displaying the number of available seats before they enter the area.

## Problem Statement

Finding available seating in public spaces like libraries can be challenging, leading to wasted time and frustration for visitors.

## Solution

Our system uses IR sensors and a microcontroller to detect and display the number of available seats. The data is shown on an LCD screen, allowing users to easily see the occupancy status.

## Product Architecture

- **Microcontroller:** ATmega 328P
- **IR Sensors:** Sharp IR sensors for detecting seat occupancy
- **Display:** 20x4 LCD with I2C module for real-time data display
- **Power Supply:** Grid power with voltage regulation

## Enclosure Design

The device's enclosure is designed using SolidWorks and is built to protect the internal components from environmental factors. It includes spaces for IR sensors, an LCD display, and a power supply.
